First day of training

In first day of training, i learned about linux in detail and different types of companies.

Linux is the core of the operating system, responsible for managing hardware resources and providing a platform for other software.

Linux is open source and much better than windows.Linux is known for its stability and security. To install Linux on laptops , there are some steps to followed:

   Download Virtualbox 7.1.10
   Download Microsoft c++ visual studio 
   Download ubnut desktop 24.04.2 LTS 
The main difference between Linux and windows is Linux is free and open source , windows are not open source. Linux considered more secure due to its open-source nature, windows are less secure. Linux is free of cost , windows are not free of cost.

Then, we discussed about different types of companies.

        product based companies 
        service based companies 
        startup companies
After that I learned about Booting and its types

Booting - Booting is the process of starting or resetting a computer. It has two main types:

cold booting and warm booting.

Cold booting is starting a computer from a completely powered-off state, while warm booting is restarting a computer that is already on.

Introduction to Kernel , Shell its types and different commands

Kernel - In an operating system, the kernel is the core component that acts as a bridge between the hardware and the software.

Shell In an operating system, a shell acts as an interface between the user and the kernel, allowing users to interact with the system by executing commands.

Types of shell

    Bash - Most common shell
    sh - original shell
    zsh- more features 
    fish- modern, interactive 
Shell categories 1. command line shell 3. Graphical shell

File System Structure

   directory              function 
   / (Root):       The top-level directory, from which all other directories branch out.
 
  /bin:            Contains executable programs .
 
  /boot:            Stores files needed for booting the system, including the kernel.

Dual Booting Dual-booting refers to the process of installing and running two different operating systems on a single computer, allowing the user to choose which one to use when starting the machine.

BARE METAL INSTALLATION

Bare metal installation of linux means installing the operating on a computer's hardware , without any intermediary virtualization software.

VM ware

vm ware is a commercial product known for its enterprise - grade features , performence and comprehensive support .

Partitioning Schemes : Dividing a hard disk into seperate sections . Each section acts as an independent disk. Help organize data and install multiple OS.

Its Types:

MBR(MASTER BOOT RECORD )

maximum 4 primary partitions . Support upto 2 TB.It stores partition info in one place.It has less flexibility.

GPT(GUID PARTITION TABLE)

It supports upto 128 partitions .It supports disks larger than 2 TB.More flexibile.

File and directory permissions

File permissions are the backbone of Linux security, ensuring that only authorized users and processes interact with your data.

Types of Commands 1 chomd (change mode)

      1. It is used to change the permissions(read, write, execute) of files or directories.
      syntax - chmod[permission] [filename]*for permission 

      2.  chmod +x filename.sh
               +x enables execute files.
  
     3. chmod 444 filename.sh
        Gives permissions to read only files.

     4. chmod 644 filename.sh
        It enables permissions only to owner 2.
2 chown- change owner

    chown user:group file.txt
    Change the owner to user Change the group to group so that other users in that group can access the file .

File compression

File Compression in linux , helping to reduce the sizes of files .

Use of File Compression

Save Storage Space: Compressed file take up less disk space, allowing you to store more data.

Faster transmission : Smaller files transfer more qyickly over networks.

There are several commands available for compressing files ;

Gzip - used to compress file. It reduce the size of files , making them eaiser and faster to store or transfer.It compress the filename and replace it with filename.gz.

syntax - gzip filename

e.g- gzip notes.txt creates notes.txt.gz and delete notes.txt

This command wiil compress notes.txt and create a new file named notes.txt.gz, replacing the original file.

Decompress a File

To decompress notes.txt.gz weu can use the gunzip command .

gunzip notes.txt.gx

This will decompress the file and remove the .gz extension , restoring the original notes.txt file.

Keep the Original File Too

To Compress a file and keep the original , use the -k flag.

gzip -k notes.txt

Now notes.txt (kept)

notes.txt.gz (created)

This will create notes.txt.gz without deleting notes.txt.
Wildcards Command - Matches file Without full names.

        symbol                   Meaning                               Exmaple                       what it does
          *                  matches zer or more character            ls * .txt                    Lists all files ending with .txt.

          ?                  matches exactly one character            ls file? .txt                Matches files?.txt fileA.txt. etc.

          [abc]              matches one character from set         ls file[123] .txt             Matches file1.txt. file2.txt. etc

          [a-z]              matches any character in range          ls file[a-c] .txt            Matches filesa.txt .fileb.txt etc
Escaping Characters

Escaping Character means using a special symbol ( Usually a backslash) before a character to tell the computer to treat that character literally , not as a special or reserved symbol.

     character to Escape            How to Escape                        Purpose/Meaning                                                    Example

     space ()                       Use backslash\ or quotes                To treat space as part of filename or command argument.          file\ name.txt or "filename.txt     

     Backslash(\)                   Use double backslash \\                 To represent a literal backslash                                echo \\ prints \

     Dollar sign($)                 Use backslash \$                        To prevent variable expansion                                   echo\$HOME prints $HOME
      
     Asterisk(*)                    Use backslash\*                         To treat * literally ,not as a wildcard                        ls \*.txt lists files named*.txt literally

     Question mark (?)              Use backslash\?                         To treat ? literally,not as a single character wildcard        ls file\?.txt matches file?.txt literally

      Quotes(" or ')               Use backslash\" or \' inside quotes,     To include quotes in strings                                    echo "He said \"Hi\""
                                   or use different quotes type  

     Brackets ([])                 Use backslash\[and \]                    To treat brackets literally                                     ls file\[1\].txt matches file[1].txt
Quotes

   QuoteType   	        Syntax             	Description                                              	Example

  Single quotes        	'text'            Preserves literal value of all characters inside.         	'Hello $USER * ?' outputs exactly Hello $USER * ?

  Double quotes        	"text"           Preserves most characters literally, but allows            "Hello $USER" outputs Hello followed by your username
                                      
                                         variable expansion and command substitution 

  Backslash             \char             Escapes the next character to be treated literally
